  XGine Ragnabot - Patch Notes v4.0.4.9
  March 2, 2026
========================================

[IMPORTANT] HWID Transfer Notice
  • If you have verified before and have the Discord role,
    your Discord is linked to your old HWID. Use /change_hwid to update it.
  • If you have NOT verified your HWID via Discord before,
    you must contact your reseller or developer to transfer your HWID.
  • If you cannot update your HWID, stay on v4.0.4.6 which is available at:
    https://github.com/7847696e65/xgine-ragnabot-updater/releases

[NEW] Discord Command: /change_hwid
  • Change your HWID directly via Discord bot
  • Must be verified first using /verify
  • 5 HWID changes allowed per month (auto-resets each calendar month)
  • Tracks usage in database — persists across server restarts
  • Validates against duplicate HWIDs and same-HWID submissions

[IMPROVED] Hardware ID System
  • Enhanced device identification for better account security
  • Improved compatibility across Windows 7-11 and virtual machines
  • More stable across Windows updates and hardware changes
  • Prevents duplicate device IDs on identical hardware

[FIX] WinAPI Mode Alt-Tab Click Fix
  • Fixed mouse clicks not registering when game is alt-tabbed
  • Removed incorrect ScreenToClient conversion that caused negative coordinates
  • Added bit-masking safety for coordinate packing

[FIX] WinAPI Smartwalk Cursor Not Moving
  • Fixed cursor position not updating during pathfinding walk
  • Cursor position is now set before walk trigger (correct order)
  • Clamped coordinates to valid window range to prevent silent drops

[FIX] Bot Stops When Alt-Tabbed (WinAPI Mode)
  • Cursor checker no longer blocks the bot loop in WinAPI mode
  • Physical cursor position is now ignored when using memory-based input
  • Bot continues walking, attacking, and looting while alt-tabbed

[OPTIMIZE] Pathfinding Performance (Core 2 Duo / VM Support)
  • Inlined neighbor generation to reduce memory allocations per A* iteration
  • Added BFS reachability pre-filter — scores all candidates cheaply before running A*
  • Early termination after finding enough good paths (3-5 instead of exhaustive search)
  • Single-core VM detection: skips async pre-calc to avoid CPU contention
  • 2-core VM: forces Fastest mode for background pre-calculation
  • Removed ~900 lines of dead legacy pathfinding code
  • Result: Less idle time, lower CPU usage, smoother botting on low-end machines
